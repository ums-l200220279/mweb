We welcome contributions from all team members. Please see [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed guidelines.

### Feature Development Process

1. **Planning**: All new features should start with a ticket in our project management system
   - Ensure requirements are clear and acceptance criteria are defined
   - Break down complex features into smaller, manageable tasks

2. **Implementation**:
   - Create a feature branch from `main` using the format `feature/ticket-id-short-description`
   - Follow the code style and architecture guidelines
   - Write tests for all new functionality
   - Document your code with JSDoc comments

3. **Code Review**:
   - All code must be reviewed by at least one other developer
   - Address all review comments before merging
   - Use the pull request template to provide context

4. **Testing**:
   - Ensure all tests pass locally before pushing
   - Verify your changes in the preview deployment
   - For UI changes, test across different browsers and devices

5. **Documentation**:
   - Update relevant documentation
   - Add inline comments for complex logic
   - Consider adding examples for API endpoints or components

### Bug Fix Process

1. **Reproduction**: Always start by reproducing the bug
2. **Investigation**: Identify the root cause
3. **Fix**: Implement the smallest possible change that fixes the issue
4. **Testing**: Add a test that would have caught the bug
5. **Documentation**: Document the fix and any relevant information

## Performance Guidelines

Performance is critical for Memoright, especially for elderly users who may have less powerful devices or slower internet connections.

### Frontend Performance

1. **Bundle Size**:
   - Use dynamic imports for large components or libraries
   - Monitor bundle size with `npm run analyze`
   - Aim to keep the initial bundle under 200KB (compressed)

2. **Rendering Optimization**:
   - Use React.memo for components that render often but rarely change
   - Implement virtualization for long lists using `react-window` or `react-virtualized`
   - Optimize images using Next.js Image component with proper sizing

3. **State Management**:
   - Keep state as local as possible
   - Use React Query for server state to minimize unnecessary refetches
   - Implement proper caching strategies

### Backend Performance

1. **Database Queries**:
   - Use indexes for frequently queried fields
   - Implement pagination for all list endpoints
   - Use database transactions for operations that modify multiple records

2. **API Response Times**:
   - Aim for <100ms response time for critical endpoints
   - Implement caching for expensive operations
   - Use database connection pooling

3. **Monitoring**:
   - All API endpoints should include performance monitoring
   - Set up alerts for endpoints that exceed response time thresholds
   - Regularly review performance metrics and address issues

### Performance Testing

1. **Load Testing**:
   - Run load tests before major releases
   - Simulate realistic user scenarios
   - Test with at least 10x expected concurrent users

2. **Lighthouse Scores**:
   - Aim for scores of 90+ in all categories
   - Address any performance issues identified by Lighthouse
   - Run Lighthouse tests in CI for critical pages

## Security Guidelines

As a healthcare application, security is paramount for Memoright. Follow these guidelines to ensure the application remains secure:

### Authentication and Authorization

1. **User Authentication**:
   - Always use NextAuth.js for authentication
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure cookies with HttpOnly and SameSite flags

2. **Authorization**:
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC)
   - Verify permissions on both client and server
   - Never rely solely on UI hiding for security

3. **API Security**:
   - Validate all input data with Zod schemas
   - Implement rate limiting for authentication endpoints
   - Use CSRF tokens for state-changing operations

### Data Protection

1. **Sensitive Data**:
   - Encrypt all PHI (Protected Health Information) at rest
   - Never log sensitive information
   - Implement proper data anonymization for research

2. **Database Security**:
   - Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
   - Implement least privilege access for database users
   - Regularly backup and test database restores

3. **Frontend Security**:
   - Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)

## Accessibility Guidelines

Memoright is designed to be accessible to all users, including elderly individuals and those with cognitive impairments. Follow these guidelines to ensure the application remains accessible:

### Design Principles

1. **Text and Typography**:
   - Use a minimum font size of 16px for body text
   - Maintain a color contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1 for text

   - Ensure all interactive elements have a minimum touch target size of 44x44px
   - Provide clear focus indicators for keyboard navigation
   - Implement consistent navigation patterns across the application

3. **Content Structure**:
   - Use semantic HTML elements (headings, lists, etc.)
   - Maintain a logical tab order
   - Group related form elements with fieldsets and legends

### Implementation Guidelines

1. **ARIA Attributes**:
   - Use ARIA landmarks to define page regions
   - Add aria-label or aria-labelledby to elements without visible text
   - Implement aria-live regions for dynamic content

2. **Keyboard Accessibility**:
   - Ensure all functionality is available via keyboard
   - Use proper focus management for modals and dialogs
   - Implement keyboard shortcuts for common actions

3. **Assistive Technology Support**:
   - Test with screen readers (NVDA, VoiceOver)
