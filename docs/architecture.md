# Memoright Architecture Documentation

## Overview

Memoright is an AI-powered cognitive health platform designed to provide early detection, personalized care, and continuous support for better brain health. This document outlines the architecture, design decisions, and technical implementation details.

## Architecture Principles

1. **Modular Design**: Components are designed to be self-contained with clear interfaces
2. **Scalability**: System can handle increasing load without significant changes
3. **Security**: Patient data is protected with multiple layers of security
4. **Accessibility**: UI/UX is designed to be accessible to all users
5. **Performance**: System is optimized for fast response times and minimal resource usage

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is built using Next.js with the App Router, implementing a micro-frontend architecture for scalability and maintainability.
