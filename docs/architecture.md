## Observability Architecture

Comprehensive observability is essential for maintaining and troubleshooting Memoright in production. This section details our approach to monitoring, logging, and tracing.

### Monitoring Strategy

1. **Infrastructure Monitoring**:
   - Server metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network)
   - Container metrics
   - Database performance metrics
   - Queue lengths and processing rates

2. **Application Monitoring**:
   - Request rates and latencies
   - Error rates and types
   - Endpoint performance
   - Background job execution

3. **Business Metrics**:
   - User engagement metrics
   - Assessment completion rates
   - Cognitive improvement trends
   - Conversion and retention metrics

### Logging Architecture

1. **Log Collection**:
   - Structured logging in JSON format
   - Centralized log aggregation
   - Log shipping with minimal latency
   - Buffering and retry mechanisms

2. **Log Levels and Categories**:
   - ERROR: Exceptions and failures requiring attention
   - WARN: Potential issues not affecting functionality
   - INFO: Significant events in normal operation
   - DEBUG: Detailed information for troubleshooting
   - AUDIT: Security and compliance events

3. **Context Enrichment**:
   - Request ID for correlation
   - User ID and session information
   - Service and environment identifiers
   - Source code references

### Distributed Tracing

1. **Trace Propagation**:
   - W3C Trace Context standard
   - Consistent trace ID across service boundaries
   - Span hierarchy for operation nesting

2. **Span Attributes**:
   - Operation name and type
   - Timing information
   - Error flags and messages
   - Custom attributes for business context

3. **Sampling Strategy**:
   - Head-based sampling for high-volume operations
   - Tail-based sampling for error detection
   - Priority sampling for critical paths

### Health Checking

1. **Endpoint Health**:
   - Liveness probes for basic availability
   - Readiness probes for service availability
   - Synthetic transactions for functional verification

2. **Dependency Health**:
   - Database connectivity checks
   - External API availability monitoring
   - Cache service health verification

3. **Composite Health**:
   - Aggregated health status
   - Degraded service detection
   - Health score calculation

### Alerting Framework

1. **Alert Definition**:
   - Clear thresholds based on SLOs
   - Multi-condition alerts to reduce noise
   - Alert severity classification

2. **Alert Routing**:
   - On-call rotation integration
   - Escalation policies
   - Different channels based on severity

3. **Alert Response**:
   - Runbooks for common alerts
   - Automated remediation where possible
   - Post-mortem process for critical incidents

### Visualization and Dashboards

1. **Operational Dashboards**:
   - Real-time service health
   - Error rates and latencies
   - Resource utilization

2. **Business Dashboards**:
   - User activity and engagement
   - Assessment metrics
   - Cognitive health trends

3. **Executive Dashboards**:
   - SLA compliance
   - Key performance indicators
   - Growth metrics
